 # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


To run the code correctly, follow these steps:

Download the zip file named Sadaam-personal-portfolios-main.
Extract the file.
Open Visual Studio Code.
Use the Open File option or drag and drop to open the extracted folder in Visual Studio Code.
Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code.
In the terminal, type npm run dev and press Enter.
Once the server starts, click on the link that appears (use Ctrl+click if necessary) to open the browser and view the beautiful personal portfolio output.
